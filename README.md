## About Me

Hi, I'm Brandon Boatright, an experienced Supervisory Team Lead with a passion for solving complex business problems through data-driven solutions and the latest technology. With a strong background in software support (SaaS), cloud computing, and team leadership, I thrive in fast-paced environments where adaptability, multi-tasking, and technical expertise are crucial.

I believe in the power of organization and efficiency when managing both projects and teams. To streamline workflows and ensure timely project delivery, I use tools like **Asana** and **Microsoft OneNote** to organize tasks, track progress, and prioritize actions. Recently, I've begun exploring **Tableau** to enhance my data visualization skills, further improving my ability to communicate insights effectively to stakeholders. During my time as an analyst and throughout my studies at Texas Tech University, I have experience developing data-driven solutions to address real-world and organizational challenges, utilizing tools such as **GitHub**, **Power BI**, **SQL**, and various internal systems at my current employer.
